move-content-app
================

Jive app (based on node.js jive-sdk) for move content in bulk between groups / spaces

Please find my blog on Jive Community at http://bit.ly/1xGNBUA which mentions about this add-on.

This add-on is a good example which shows how jive-sdk can be used to develop node.js apps without much complex javascript frameworks.


Steps to install the add-on

1. Checkout this repository
2. put your node.js jive-sdk server's url in jiveclientconfiguration.json
3. run command "npm update" to download all the dependencies of this app.
4. Run command "node app" which will start the server and also generate an extension.zip
5. Upload the extension.zip to you Jive instance as mentioned in this offical jive document --> http://bit.ly/13zig97

The move content app is now ready to use.

The app link is displayed on the tab in groups and spaces.
